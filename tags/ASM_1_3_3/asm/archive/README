This directory contains xml files which describe the build of jars.
The following rules describe the convention to write such an xml file:

- An xml file must describe only one jar file.

- The name of the xml file is also the name of the jar:
  org_bar_foo.xml describes the content of the org_bar_foo.jar.

- Among the elements which are included into a jar, you must specify
  a manifest. It is adviced to store the manifest file in this directory.
  the manifest file can shared be by several jars. The name of the manifest
  file must be similar to the name of the jar file.

- Only the default task is called on a xml file.

- The jar file must be produced into the ${dist.lib} directory.

Sample xml file:

<project name="foo" default="dist">
  <target name="dist">
    <jar jarfile="${dist.lib}/org_bar_foo.jar"
         basedir="${build}"
         manifest="${archive}/bar.mf">
      <include name="**/*.class"/>
      <include name="**/*.vm"/>
    </jar>
  </target>
</project>
