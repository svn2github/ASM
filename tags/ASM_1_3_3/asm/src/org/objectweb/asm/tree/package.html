Provides an ASM class adapter that constructs a tree representation of the
classes it visits. This class adapter can be useful to implement "complex"
class manipulation operations, i.e., operations that would be very hard to
implement without using a tree representation (such as optimizing the number
of local variables used by a method).

<p>

However, this class adapter has a cost: it makes ASM bigger and slower. Indeed
it requires more than twenty new classes, and multiplies the time needed to
transform a class by almost two (it is almost two times faster to read, "modify"
and write a class with a ClassAdapter than with a TreeClassAdapter). This is why
this class adapter is bundled in an optional <tt>asm-tree.jar</tt> library that
is separated from (but requires) the <tt>asm.jar</tt> library, which contains
the core ASM framework. This is also why <i><font color="red">it is recommanded
not to use this class adapter when it is possible</font></i>.
