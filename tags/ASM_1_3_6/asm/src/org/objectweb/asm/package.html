Provides a small and fast bytecode manipulation framework.

<p>
The <a href="http://www.objectweb.org/asm">ASM</a> framework is organized
around the {@link org.objectweb.asm.ClassVisitor ClassVisitor} and {@link
org.objectweb.asm.CodeVisitor CodeVisitor} interfaces, which allows one to
visit the fields and methods of a class, including the bytecode instructions of
each method.

<p>
In addition to these two main interfaces, ASM provides a {@link
org.objectweb.asm.ClassReader ClassReader} class, that can parse an
existing class and make a given visitor visit it. ASM also provides
a {@link org.objectweb.asm.ClassWriter ClassWriter} class, which is
a visitor that generates Java class files.

<p>
In order to generate a class from scratch, only the {@link
org.objectweb.asm.ClassWriter ClassWriter} class is necessary. Indeed,
in order to generate a class, one must just call its visit<i>XXX</i>
methods with the appropriate arguments to generate the desired fields
and methods. See the "helloworld" example in the ASM distribution for
more details about class generation.

<p>
In order to modify existing classes, one must use a {@link
org.objectweb.asm.ClassReader ClassReader} class to analyse
the original class, a class modifier, and a {@link org.objectweb.asm.ClassWriter
ClassWriter} to construct the modified class. The class modifier
is just a {@link org.objectweb.asm.ClassVisitor ClassVisitor}
that delegates most of the work to another {@link org.objectweb.asm.ClassVisitor
ClassVisitor}, but that sometimes changes some parameter values,
or call additional methods, in order to implement the desired
modification process. In order to make it easier to implement such
class modifiers, ASM provides the {@link org.objectweb.asm.ClassAdapter
ClassAdapter} and {@link org.objectweb.asm.CodeAdapter CodeAdapter}
classes, which implement the {@link org.objectweb.asm.ClassVisitor ClassVisitor} and
{@link org.objectweb.asm.CodeVisitor CodeVisitor} interfaces by delegating
all work to other visitors. See the "adapt" example in the ASM distribution
for more details about class modification.

<p>
The size of the core ASM library, <tt>asm.jar</tt>, is only 22KB, which is much
more smaller than
the size of the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/bcel">BCEL</a> library (350KB
without the class verifier), and than the size of the
<a href="http://serp.sourceforge.net">SERP</a> library (150KB). ASM is also
much more faster than these tools. Indeed the overhead of a load time class
transformation process is of the order of 60% with ASM, 700% or more with BCEL,
and 1100% or more with SERP (see the <tt>test/perf</tt> directory in the ASM
distribution)! kASM is a subset of ASM, for class generation only (it includes
the {@link org.objectweb.asm.ClassWriter ClassWriter}, but not the {@link
org.objectweb.asm.ClassReader ClassReader}). The size of this library,
<tt>kasm.jar</tt>, is only 15KB.
