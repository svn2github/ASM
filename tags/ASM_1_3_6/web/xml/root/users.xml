          because it's exactly what I need to finish BeanShell scripted classes...
          [...] I didn't want to use BCEL because it's huge relative to BeanShell
          (my core language is about 100K). All I really need is the ability to
          generate a proxy class for an arbitrary type (delegate all the methods
          to a reflective style handler) which I believe will now be easy.

          distributed, and concurrent computing, also featuring mobility and
          security in a uniform framework. With a reduced set of simple
          primitives, ProActive provides a comprehensive API allowing to
          simplify the programming of applications that are distributed on
          Local Area Network (LAN), on cluster of workstations, or on
          Internet Grids. ProActive uses ASM to dynamically generate stub
          and proxy classes.</td>
