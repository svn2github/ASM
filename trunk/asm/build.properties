#Some information about the product
product.name    ASM

# Wich compiler do you want use ?
# jikes is faster than javac but keeps line numbers in compiled classes, even
# with the -O option (javac removes line numbers and local variable names with
# this option, resulting in smaller classes)
build.compiler modern
