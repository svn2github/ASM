/**
 * The EnclosingMethod attribute is an optional fixed-length attribute in 
 * the attributes table of the ClassFile structure. A class must have an 
 * EnclosingMethod attribute if and only if it is a local class or an 
 * anonymous class. A class may have no more than one EnclosingMethod attribute.
 * 
 * The EnclosingMethod attribute has the following format:
 * <pre>
 *   EnclosingMethod_attribute {
 *     u2 attribute_name_index;
 *     u4 attribute_length;
 *     u2 class_index
 *     u2 method_index;
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * The items of the EnclosingMethod_attribute structure are as follows:
 * <dl>
 * <dt>attribute_name_index</dt>
 * <dd>The value of the attribute_name_index item must be a valid index
 * into the constant_pool table. The constant_pool entry at that index
 * must be a CONSTANT_Utf8_info structure representing the
 * string "EnclosingMethod".</dd>
 * <dt>attribute_length</dt>
 * <dd>The value of the attribute_length item is four.</dd>
 * <dt>class_index</dt>
 * <dd>The value of the class_index item must be a valid index into the
 * constant_pool table. The constant_pool entry at that index must be a
 * CONSTANT_Class_info structure representing the
 * innermost class that encloses the declaration of the current class.</dd>
 * <dt>method_index</dt>
 * <dd>If the current class is not immediately enclosed by a method or
 * constructor, then the value of the method_index item must be zero.
 * Otherwise, the value of the method_index item must be a valid
 * index into the constant_pool table. The constant_pool entry at that
 * index must be a CONSTANT_NameAndType_info structure
 * representing a the name and type of a method in the class
 * referenced by the class_index attribute above. It is the
 * responsibility of the Java compiler to ensure that the method
 * identified via the method_index is indeed the closest lexically
 * enclosing method of the class that contains this EnclosingMethod
 * attribute.</dd>
 * </dl>
