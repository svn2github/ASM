    <p>
    <strong>ASM</strong> is a Java bytecode manipulation framework. It can be used
    to dynamically generate stub classes or other proxy classes, directly in binary
    form, or to dynamically modify classes at load time, i.e., just before they are
    loaded into the Java Virtual Machine.</p>

    <p>ASM offers similar functionalities as <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/bcel/">BCEL</a>
    or <a href="http://serp.sourceforge.net/">SERP</a>, but is much more smaller (22KB
    instead of 350KB for BCEL and 150KB for SERP)
    and faster than these tools (the overhead of a load time class transformation
    is of the order of 60% with ASM, 700% or more with BCEL, and 1100% or more with SERP).
    Indeed ASM was designed to be used in a dynamic way* and
    was therefore designed and implemented to be as small and as fast as possible.</p>

    <p>(*) ASM can of course be used in a static way too.</p>
