	<h1>Introduction to the ASMDEX Bytecode Framework</h1>

	<h2>What is ASMDEX ?</h2>


	<p>ASMDEX is a bytecode manipulation library as ASM but it handles
		the DEX bytecode used by Android executables. Only the core library
		and and a tool to convert bytecode to code generating it (asmdexifier)
		are available. The underlying principle while developing ASMDEX was to
		keep it very similar to ASM to ease the cost of porting tools done for
		Oracle Java bytecode to Android bytecode.</p>

	<h2>Differences between ASM and ASMDEX</h2>


	<p>Although the underlying principle was to keep ASMDEX close to
		ASM, there are still a lot of differences that the user must keep in
		mind :</p>

	<ol>

		<li>The code unit is the application and not the class. An
			Android application is a ZIP archive as a JAR file but its content is
			a set of resources (most of them are compiled XML files) and a single
			code file that contains all the application code. The name of this
			file is <span style="font-family: monospace;">classes.dex</span>
		</li>
		<li>There is a single constant pool in <span
			style="font-family: monospace;">classes.dex</span> which is organized
			as a set of <span style="font-style: italic;">sorted</span> tables.
			Any modification in a class may disturb this sorting and may have an
			impact on the complete code unit.
			<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Although ASM follows the
				visitor pattern while building an application, this is not in fact a
				single pass process but a two pass one where the second pass is used
				to compute the actual indices of items identified during the first
				pass.</div></li>
		<li>The Dalvik virtual machine that executes the bytecode is a
			register based machine and not a stack based machine.
			<ul>
				<li>Method arguments, local variables but also intermediate
					computations and parameters of called methods are all put in
					registers in the stack frame.</li>
				<li>Method arguments are put in the registers with the highest
					numbers.</li>
				<li>Although formally indistinguishable there are at least four
					class of registers:
					<ul>
						<li>the 16th first registers are available for most
							operations, especially if the operation requires several
							registers.</li>
						<li>The next limit is 256. Most unary operations use this
							limit because instructions are coded on 16 bits and the opcode
							takes 8 bits.</li>
						<li>There is a small set of operation that can handle the
							potential 65536 different registers of a method. There is usually
							'16' in the name of the opcode.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>There are two ways to specify the arguments of a method
					call:
					<ul>
						<li>If the number of arguments is small (5 or less), one can
							use any arbitrary combination of the first 16 registers.</li>
						<li>Otherwise, it is necessary to use a slice of consecutive
							registers.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul> Because of all the previous constraints, it can be difficult to
			introduce new intermediate computations. Even adding a new
			intermediate register is not easy because it must shift the method
			parameters and so it may move one of them out of the 16 registers
			limit that could be necessary for some operations.
		</li>
		<li>Finally there is a system constraint imposed by the virtual
			machine itself : because code is in fact a memory mapped structure
			comprising the whole code of the application, it is not possible to
			modify the code of a class dynamically. In fact, because of the
			second constraint, it would be hard to modify a single class anyway,
			without modifying the code of the other classes.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>The last constraint limits the use of ASMDEX. Otherwise, the
		most severe programming constraint for the ASMDEX user is probably the
		third one. One way to get around is to try to introduce as few changes
		as possible and rather rely on external (but potentially generated)
		method to perform the real work. A future release of ASMDEX may
		provide a generic register allocation method visitor to simplify the
		development of transformations.</p>

	<h2>A simple example</h2>
	<p>Here is a canvas of a tool that logs some method calls according
		to a policy that identifies the methods to check. To keep the tutorial
		short and generic, we will not describe the class implementing the
		policy. We will not describe the generation of the log methods either.</p>

	<h3>The entry point</h3>
	<p>This is a very simple entry point. We consider the case where
		the classes.dex file has been extracted from the APK. You may want to
		perform the change in place. But in any case, you must sign your
		application again to install it.</p>

	<pre>
public class AnnotateCalls {
	public static void main(String args[])  {
	FileOutputStream os = null;
	try {
			int api = Opcodes.ASM4;
			File inFile;
			File outFile;
			... // Argument validation
			AnnotRulesManager rm = ...; // Rules to apply
			ApplicationReader ar = new ApplicationReader(api, inFile);
			ApplicationWriter aw = new ApplicationWriter();
			ApplicationVisitor aa = new ApplicationAdapterAnnotateCalls(api, rm, aw);
			ar.accept(aa, 0);
			byte [] b = aw.toByteArray();
			os = new FileOutputStream(outFile);
			os.write(b);
		} catch (IOException e) { // recovery
		} finally { // cleanup }
	}
}
</pre>
	<h3>The application visitor</h3>
	<p>
		This is a new element specific to ASMDEX and represents the complete
		code unit (classes.dex). We use the end visitor to dump the new class.
		The system will take care of sorting the elements as they should be.
		<code>logClassWriter</code>
		relies on the rule manager to know which log methods it should define.
		You can use asmdexifier to define the template of your log method from
		an existing class.
	</p>
	<pre>
public class ApplicationAdapterAnnotateCalls extends ApplicationVisitor {
 	final LogClassWriter logClassWriter;
 	final AnnotRulesManager ruleManager;
 	
 	public ApplicationAdapterAnnotateCalls(int api, AnnotRulesManager rm, ApplicationVisitor av) {
 		super(api, av);
 		ruleManager = rm;
 		logClassWriter = new LogClassWriter(rm,av);
 	}
 	
 	@Override
 	public ClassVisitor visitClass(int access, String name, String [] signature, String superName, String [] interfaces) {
 		ClassVisitor cv = av.visitClass(access, name, signature, superName, interfaces);
 		ClassAdapterAnnotateCalls ca = new ClassAdapterAnnotateCalls(api, ruleManager,cv);
 		return ca;
 	}
 	@Override
 	public void visitEnd() {
 		logClassWriter.addLogClass();
 		av.visitEnd();
 	}
 }
</pre>
	<h3>The class visitor</h3>

	<p>There is nothing interesting in this one. It delegates all the
		work to the method visitor.</p>
	<pre>
public class ClassAdapterAnnotateCalls extends ClassVisitor {
 
 	final private AnnotRulesManager ruleManager;
 
 	public ClassAdapterAnnotateCalls(int api, AnnotRulesManager ruleManager, ClassVisitor cv) {
 		super(api, cv);
 		this.ruleManager = ruleManager;
 	}
 	
 	@Override
 	public MethodVisitor visitMethod(int access, String name, String desc, String[] signature,
 			String[] exceptions) {
 		MethodVisitor mv = cv.visitMethod(access, name, desc, signature, exceptions);
 		MethodAdapterAnnotateCalls ma = new MethodAdapterAnnotateCalls(api, ruleManager, mv);
 		return ma;
 	}
 }
 </pre>
	<h3>The method visitor</h3>
	<p>This is where the real work is done. The method visiting method
		calls is redefined to generate a new method call followed by the
		original one when the method should be logged. Whether something must
		be done is in the result of the call to the rule manager. If this is a
		function, it should be understood as the name of a method in the
		generated log class. This log method is static and takes as many
		arguments as the controlled method.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Note that you cannot log a call to a constructor this way.</li>
		<li>The syntax of method signature in Dalvik is different from
			the one used in Oracle JVM. It is coded as <code>RA...A</code>
			instead of <code>(A...A)R</code> where <code>A</code> stands for the
			type descriptor of an argument and <code>R</code> for the type
			descriptor of the result.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<pre>
public class MethodAdapterAnnotateCalls extends MethodVisitor {
 
 	final private AnnotRulesManager ruleManager;
 
 	public MethodAdapterAnnotateCalls(int api, AnnotRulesManager ruleManager, MethodVisitor mv) {
 		super(api, mv);
 		this.ruleManager = ruleManager;
 	}
 	
 	@Override
 	public void visitMethodInsn(int opcode, java.lang.String owner, java.lang.String name, java.lang.String desc, int[] arguments) {
 		boolean isStatic;
 		String signature;
 		switch (opcode) {
 		case Opcodes.INSN_INVOKE_STATIC:
 		case Opcodes.INSN_INVOKE_STATIC_RANGE:
 			isStatic=true;
 			break;
 		default:
 			isStatic=false;
 		}
 		String logItName = ruleManager.log(owner,name,desc,isStatic);
 		if (logItName != null) {
 			if (isStatic) signature = "V" + MethodSignature.popType(desc);
 			else signature = "V" + owner + MethodSignature.popType(desc);
 			int opcodeStatic = (opcode &lt; 0x74) ? Opcodes.INSN_INVOKE_STATIC : Opcodes.INSN_INVOKE_STATIC_RANGE; 
 			mv.visitMethodInsn(opcodeStatic, LogClassWriter.LOG_CLASSNAME, logItName, signature, arguments);
 		}
 		mv.visitMethodInsn(opcode, owner, name, desc, arguments);
 	}
 	
 }
 
</pre>
	<p>We need to get the list of parameter's types without the result
		type and this is done by "poping" the result type from the
		representation. Here is the relevant code from the MethodSignature
		class:</p>
	<pre>
/**
 * Gives back all the types from a list but the first. Used to parse a method
 * signature in Dalvik format.
 * @param desc a string coded as a list of type descriptions
 * @return the string without the first type
 */
public static String popType(String desc) {
    return desc.substring(nextTypePosition(desc,0));
}


/**
 * Get the point where the next type description ends.
 * @param desc  a string coded as a  list of type descriptions
 * @param pos position to start from.
 * @return the position of first character of the next type.
 */
</pre>
	<pre>
public static int nextTypePosition(String desc, int pos) {
    while(desc.charAt(pos) == '[') pos ++;
    if (desc.charAt(pos) == 'L') pos = desc.indexOf(';', pos);
    pos ++;
    return pos;
}
</pre>
